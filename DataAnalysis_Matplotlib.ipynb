The most important position on the offensive side, the quarterback is responsible for receiving the play from the coaches on the sideline and communicating the play to the other offensive players in the huddle.\n","    \n","**OT (Offensive tackle)**\n","\n","      Two tackles play outside of the guards. Their role is primarily to block on both running and passing plays. The area from one tackle to the other is an area of \"close line play\" in which blocks from behind, which are prohibited elsewhere on the field, are allowed.

Tight ends are considered hybrid players, something between a wide receiver and an offensive lineman.

However, because they are eligible receivers, they may also catch passes.\n","\n","\n","**K (Kicker)**\n","  \n","    Also called the \"placekicker\", he handles kickoffs, extra points, and field goal attempts.

middle, and rushing the quarterback on blitz plays.\n","\n","**NT (Nose Tackle)**\n","\n","    The most interior defensive tackle who sometimes lines up directly across from the ball (and therefore is
