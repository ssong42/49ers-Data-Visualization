# 49ers-Data-Visualization
Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize sports statistics.

This project was created as a worksheet for 49ers data science camp in partnership with 42.
This worksheet will teach students on the fundamentals of pandas and seaborn library
I created both matplotlib and seaborn worksheets, but I believe seaborn is better for use with pandas.
